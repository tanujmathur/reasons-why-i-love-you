<!-- # Daddy or Chips? Google Home Action

Truly a question for the ages... since time immemorial people have wondered, which is better - Daddy or Chips?

Now Google Home will tell you, and provide a useful starting point for building your own Google Home agents using Webhooks with API.ai on Glitch.

It's based on Google's example [API.AI Webhook Template for Actions](https://github.com/actions-on-google/apiai-webhook-template-nodejs) project.
